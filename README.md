# Learning :-)
This is made to learn &amp; explore new tech &amp; research.

## Software Architecture
The presented architectures are designed based on three factors: 
### distributed or non-distributed
### front-end (server-side or client-side)
### monolithic or microservices
cloud computing canâ€™t do much if systems are still designed in deployment monolithic approach where software applications are deployed as a single unit. Even though the monolithic approach is easy to understand by developers and has been adopted for decades, it has become a bottleneck with the new technology trends.
In the monolithic approach, software systems are developed most likely in the same technology stack, cluster-based replication as a scalability strategy.
Microservices architecture is based on developing software projects into modular services that are: small, self-contained, self-deployable, designed around business capabilities, manage its own data, and communicate with other services over a lightweight protocol (most likely HTTP).
